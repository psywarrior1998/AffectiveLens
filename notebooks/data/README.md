# üìä MoodPulse: Processed Data and Embeddings for Emotion Analysis

**MoodPulse** provides a self-contained dataset repository for use with the [AffectiveLens](https://github.com/your-username/AffectiveLens) project‚Äîan end-to-end NLP pipeline for emotion detection in text. It includes the full processing stack from raw text to final DistilBERT-based sentence embeddings, allowing researchers to bypass time-consuming preprocessing and directly train or benchmark models.

---

## üßæ Dataset Description

This dataset builds upon the original **[GoEmotions](https://github.com/google-research/goemotions)** dataset by Google Research, which includes 58k carefully curated Reddit comments labeled with 28 fine-grained emotions.

In **MoodPulse**, these labels are condensed into **three mutually exclusive emotion classes**:
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative

The dataset is structured to support every phase of the AffectiveLens pipeline:
- Raw CSVs
- Tokenized data in Hugging Face `datasets` format
- Precomputed `DistilBERT` embeddings

This enables full reproduction of results without requiring re-tokenization or embedding computation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into logical folders corresponding to different stages of processing:

```

/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goemotions\_1.csv

‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MentalTest/

````

### üìÅ Folder Descriptions

- **`data/full_dataset/`**  
  Original GoEmotions CSV files split into parts.

- **`data/processed/`**  
  Tokenized datasets using Hugging Face `datasets` format, ready for embedding extraction.

- **`data/embeddings/`**  
  Final DistilBERT `[CLS]` token embeddings for the training and test sets. These are saved as Hugging Face datasets and ready for model input.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

You can load the tokenized data or precomputed embeddings directly using the Hugging Face `datasets` library.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Define repository ID and folder to load
repo_id = "psyrishi/MoodPulse"
data_folder = "data/embeddings/MentalTrain"  # or "data/embeddings/MentalTest"

# Load the dataset split
train_embeddings = load_dataset(repo_id, data_dir=data_folder, split='train')

print("Sample entry:")
print(train_embeddings[0])

# Access embeddings and labels
embedding_vector = train_embeddings[0]['cls_embedding']
label_vector = train_embeddings[0]['labels']
````

> üí° Tip: You can replace `data_dir` to load the tokenized datasets instead, if desired.

## üìå Use Cases

* Train or benchmark emotion classification models using high-quality, preprocessed embeddings.
* Compare performance of traditional ML models vs. transformer-based models.
* Build emotion-aware applications for mental health, customer feedback, or social media monitoring.
